> 🥰There must be one thing in this world that only u can do it.

Hi! I'm Judy (She/Her), an 18-year-old designer/artist/developer(still learning!) at UC Berkeley. Having insane passion for art and always observing the world from an innovative perspective. You might usually see me:
- decide to art note-taking while watching anime
- start analyzing the user interface using any app
- write something excitedly on a little notebook at a random moment (🎆 of inspiration)
