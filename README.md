Hi! I'm Judy (She/Her), a 16-year-old designer/artist/developer(still learning!) in the USA, CA. Having insanely passion for art and always observing the world from an innovative perspective. You might usually see me:
- decide to art note-taking while watching anime
- start analyzing the user interface using any app
- write something excitedly on a little notebook at a random moment (🎆 of inspiration)
